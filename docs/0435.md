### **该角色目前尚未开放。**

### 描述

We're looking for a new **part-time technical editor** to join the Java editorial team. The role involves working with authors, **reviewing their new article drafts,** and providing helpful feedback. The goal is to make sure that the article hits a high level of quality before it gets published. More specifically – articles should match [the Baeldung formatting, code, and style guidelines](/web/20221208143856/https://www.baeldung.com/contribution-guidelines#guidelines). **Beyond formatting and style**, articles should be code-focused, clean, and easy to understand. Sometimes an article is almost there, but not quite – and the author needs to be guided towards a better solution or a better way of explaining some technical concepts.

### **合适的人选？**

First – **you need to be a developer yourself**, working or actively involved in the Java and Spring ecosystem. All of these articles are code-centric, so being in the trenches and able to code is instrumental. Any experience with Scala, Kotlin, or Linux is a plus as well. Second – and it almost goes without saying – you should have an excellent command of the English language.

### **预算和时间承诺**

You're going to be **working with 6-7 authors** to help them with their articles (you can choose to work with fewer or more authors depending on your availability). An article usually takes about two rounds of review until it's ready to go. All of this usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes of work for a small to a medium article and can take 60 minutes for larger writeups. The budget for each article is based on your editor level and the number of words. Here are some typical budgets used by editors:

*   第九级–975 个单词–59 美元
*   第九级–1175 个单词–63 美元
*   第 13 级–975 个单词–65 美元
*   第 13 级–1175 个单词–69 美元

Your level is determined by internal metrics such as response time and feedback from the senior editors, and the max level is 20\. **The average earning is around 600$/month.**
